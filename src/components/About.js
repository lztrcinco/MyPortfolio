           I am Jan Lester Espinosa Cinco with a passion for learning new languages and problem solving techniques.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Before transitioning into web and software development, I diligently worked as a Data Entry Specialist in the Call Center Company in Los Ba√±os, Laguna. While in the legal industry I found myself enjoying the technical and computer driven aspects of the office which lead me to follow my true passion for Web Development.
